#Blank Wordpress Theme with Grunt and Bower

This is my own blank Wordpress theme. It uses Bootstrap 3.0 with Grunt and is meant to be 'ready to go'.

#### Features:

	* Uses Bower
	* Uses Grunt
	* Sass Compass ready
	* Basic Shortcodes included
	* Simple index layout
	* Format-{POST TYPE} files included
	* Support for the Wordpress Theme Customizer (Basic atm but will improve)

#### Grunt packages

    * grunt-contrib-watch
    * grunt-contrib-sass

#### Bower Ready

	* usually pure css for me


## Install:

	* clone into Wordpress themes folder
	* cd into newly clones folder
	* type 'grunt dev' into terminal
	* activate theme
	* start developing


###### NOTE: THIS THEME IS WRITTEN IN THE WAY THAT I LIKE TO WORK - USE AT OWN RISK.

Examples of this could be:

* Starter theme
* Learning how Wordpress does its stuff
* Anything else that you can think of
